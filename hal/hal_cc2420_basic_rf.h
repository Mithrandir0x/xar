  Description:  Basic RF library interface.

    The "Basic RF" library contains simple functions for packet transmission and
    reception with the CC2520 radio chip. The intention of this library is mainly
    to demonstrate how the CC2520 is operated, and not to provide a complete and
    fully-functional packet protocol. The protocol uses 802.15.4 MAC compliant data
    and acknowledgment packets, however it contains only a small subset of  the
    802.15.4 standard:
    - Association, scanning nor beacons are not implemented
    - No defined coordinator/device roles (peer-to-peer, all nodes are equal)
    - Waits for the channel to become ready, but does not check CCA twice
    (802.15.4 CSMA-CA)
    - Does not retransmit packets

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Startup:
    1. Create a basicRfCfg_t structure, and initialize the members:
    2. Call basicRfInit() to initialize the packet protocol.

    Transmission:
    1. Create a buffer with the payload to send
    2. Call basicRfSendPacket()

    Reception:
    1. Check if a packet is ready to be received by highger layer with
    basicRfPacketIsReady()
    2. Call basicRfReceive() to receive the packet by higher layer

    FRAME FORMATS:
    Data packets (without security):
    [Preambles (4)][SFD (1)][Length (1)][Frame control field (2)]
    [Sequence number (1)][PAN ID (2)][Dest. address (2)][Source address (2)]
    [Payload (Length - 2+1+2+2+2)][Frame check sequence (2)]

    Acknowledgment packets:
    [Preambles (4)][SFD (1)][Length = 5 (1)][Frame control field (2)]
    [Sequence number (1)][Frame check sequence (2)]

//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//      This function is a part of the basic RF library, but must be declared by the application. Once
//		the application has turned on the receiver, using basicRfReceiveOn(), all incoming packets will
//		be received by the FIFOP interrupt service routine. When finished, the ISR will call the
//		basicRfReceivePacket() function. Please note that this function must return quickly, since the
//		next received packet will overwrite the active BASIC_RF_RX_INFO structure (pointed to by pRRI).
//
//  ARGUMENTS:
//		BASIC_RF_RX_INFO *pRRI
//	      	The reception structure, which contains all relevant info about the received packet.
//
//  RETURN VALUE:
//     BASIC_RF_RX_INFO*
//			The pointer to the next BASIC_RF_RX_INFO structure to be used by the FIFOP ISR. If there is
//			only one buffer, then return pRRI.

//  SIGNAL(SIG_INTERRUPT0) - CC2420 FIFOP interrupt service routine
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//		When a packet has been completely received, this ISR will extract the data from the RX FIFO, put
//		it into the active BASIC_RF_RX_INFO structure, and call basicRfReceivePacket() (defined by the
//		application). FIFO overflow and illegally formatted packets is handled by this routine.
//
//      Note: Packets are acknowledged automatically by CC2420 through the auto-acknowledgment feature.
